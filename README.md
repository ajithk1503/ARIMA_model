# ARIMA_model
## ARIMA model for Apple Stock

This project forecasts stock prices based on historical data using the ARIMA model. The model was trained using past stock prices of companies like Apple (AAPL) and used to predict future stock prices for the next 30 trading days, representing roughly one month of market data. The model also checks for stationarity, uses differencing when necessary, and automatically identifies the best hyperparameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model.
